# Ball machine

A collaborative rube goldberg machine developed on stream at https://twitch.tv/sphaerophoria and https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL980gcR1LE3LcMxGAU1RGvXIQ20JSbuM_&si=gd3ciMP1i7501Tpd

## Expected behavior
* Simulate a 2D environment of "chambers" that balls move through
* Each chamber is defined by some wasm plugin
* Some server runs simulation non-stop
* Some client can view the simulation in real time
* Users can submit chambers to run as part of the simulation

## Chamber examples (ideas only atm)
* A cannon fires balls out of frame
* Balls orbit around some heavy mass
* Ball goes in one portal and out another
* Balls float in toilet water and get flushed out of frame
* Mario/Donkey kong but the balls are barrels
* A fan makes a ball hover in the air
